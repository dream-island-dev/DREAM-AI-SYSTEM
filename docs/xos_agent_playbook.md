# XOS Agent Playbook — Smart Dev Environment
> **Living document.** Mike + every Cursor agent reads this with `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/active_sprint.md`.
> Last updated: 2026-07-12 (session pipeline — Research→Diagnostic→Execute→QA + thin Cursor rule; agent auto-routes by task type).
>
> **When you learn something new that works** → add a bullet here + 1 line in `docs/changelog.md` + refresh `CLAUDE.md` §13 if architecture changed.

## 1. What This File Is

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Architecture truth, DB, Edge Functions, session history |
| `docs/active_sprint.md` | Current blockers + priorities |
| `RESORT_UI_MANIFEST.md` | UI/UX philosophy + tab readiness |
| **`docs/xos_agent_playbook.md`** | **How to work with Mike + how agents should behave** |

This playbook captures **process knowledge** that is not code — communication, phases, corrected assumptions, and copy-paste prompts.

---

## 2. Co-Pilot Model (Mike ↔ Agent)

Mike is a learning developer. The agent is **Lead Architect + executor**.

| Mike does | Agent does |
|---|---|
| Describes goal in **short English** (or one Hebrew line + English task) | Reads `CLAUDE.md`, `active_sprint.md`, this playbook **before acting** |
| Approves with `yes` / `כן` / `תעלה` / `yes deploy` | Runs `npm run build`, commit, push, db push, functions deploy |
| Gives one-line feedback | Small atomic diffs only — never full-file dumps |
| Works on **desktop** for visual tasks | Uses `npm start` + DevTools mobile emulation |

**Agent replies to Mike:** Hebrew, simple, max ~15 lines unless he asks for detail.
**Agent writes code/docs/commits:** English.
**Honesty Rule:** If context is lost, token limits are hit, or you simply don't know the answer, explicitly state "אני לא יודע" instead of hallucinating or guessing.

### 2.1 Mike Approval Loop (MANDATORY — how agent must behave)

Mike works on **desktop with `npm start` running**. He must **see** every change in the browser before approving.

**Agent MUST follow this loop — never skip steps:**

DO    → one small visual change (one phase step or one file chunk)

SAY   → Hebrew, short: what changed + exactly where to look in browser

WAIT  → do NOT start next change until Mike replies

BUILD → npm run build only before commit (not after every tiny edit)

PUSH  → only after Mike says yes deploy / תעלה — NEVER push without approval


**After each code edit, agent tells Mike:**

| Tell Mike | Example |
|---|---|
| URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Screen | e.g. "פתח DREAM BOT" / "תפעול ואחזקה" |
| What to look for | e.g. "ריווח בין שורות ברשימת שיחות" |
| Mobile (if touched) | "לחץ F12 → 390px width" |
| Question | **"נראה טוב? כתוב כן להמשך"** |

**Mike only needs 4 words (Hebrew or English):**

| Mike writes | Agent does |
|---|---|
| `כן` / `yes` / `המשך` / `continue` | Next small change or next phase step |
| `לא` / `fix: …` / `תקן: …` | Fix what Mike describes, then loop again |
| `עצור` / `stop` | Stop, summarize state |
| `תעלה` / `yes deploy` | commit + push (+ db/functions if needed) |

**Agent must NOT:**
- Do Phase 1 while Mike hasn't approved Phase 0 visually
- `git push` without explicit `תעלה` / `yes deploy`
- Dump long code in chat — Mike looks at **browser**, not code

**First message of session (if Mike sent kickoff prompt):**
1. Confirm `npm start` + git hash
2. Post Phase 0 diagnostic only — **no code**
3. Wait for `start phase 0` or `כן`
4. After first code edit → tell Mike where to look → **wait**

---

## 3. Token-Efficient Communication

### 3.1 Language split
- **Chat → agent:** English, short, imperative.
- **App UI in code:** Hebrew — **never change labels** unless Mike explicitly asks.
- **Agent → Mike:** Hebrew, plain language.

### 3.2 Do not repeat what's in repo docs
Use `@` references instead of re-explaining the project:

@CLAUDE.md @docs/active_sprint.md @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md
Task: [one line]
Constraints: visual only | no Hebrew label changes


### 3.3 Approval vocabulary (saves tokens)

| Mike says | Agent does |
|---|---|
| `yes` / `כן` / `תעלה` / `yes deploy` | Full deploy per checklist |
| `frontend only` | git push only (no db/functions) |
| `continue phase N` | Next UI/code phase |
| `stop` | No deploy, summarize only |

### 3.4 Standard task envelope (copy-paste)

@CLAUDE.md @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md
Scope: [file or phase]
Goal: [one line]
Constraints: [visual only | bugfix | no logic change]
Deliver: small diff + deploy checklist + offer deploy


---

## 4. Development Environment — Desktop First

### 4.1 Why desktop (not phone) for UI work
- `npm start` → instant hot reload at `http://localhost:3000`
- Phone requires `git push` → Vercel wait ~1–2 min per iteration
- Chrome DevTools device toolbar (`Ctrl+Shift+M`) simulates mobile without a physical device

### 4.2 Required viewports after any UI change
| Width | Simulates |
|---|---|
| 390px | Phone |
| 768px | Tablet / mobile-bar breakpoint |
| 1280px+ | DeX / large tablet (`App.js` has DeX media queries) |

### 4.3 Dual-surface rule (desktop Wow + mobile comfort)
**Build on desktop. Ship for both.** Every UI phase has two acceptance gates:

| Surface | Goal | How we verify |
|---|---|---|
| **Desktop** (1280px+) | Premium, spacious, scannable KPIs | DevTools wide + DeX breakpoint |
| **Mobile** (≤768px) | Thumb-safe, no overlap, keyboard OK | DevTools 390px + 768px **after each phase** |
| **Real phone** | Touch + scroll + keyboard in production | Once per phase batch on Vercel URL |

**Not optional:** Agent posts a **Mobile Checklist** (pass/fail per item) at the end of every UI phase before offering deploy.

### 4.4 Mobile comfort standards (staff)
- **Hit target:** min 44px staff / 48px comfort / 72px kiosk (cleaners) — use tokens from Phase 0.
- **Thumb zone:** primary CTAs bottom-weighted on phone where possible (Inbox send, task actions).
- **No overlap:** content `padding-bottom` clears `.mobile-bar` (~80px); floating widgets (AICopilot, alerts) above bar.
- **RTL:** badges `white-space: nowrap` or controlled wrap — no clipped Hebrew.
- **Keyboard:** reply inputs not hidden when mobile keyboard opens (Inbox `minHeight:0` pattern — preserve it).
- **Disable don't hide:** same on mobile — muted buttons with `title`, never `display:none` on actions.

### 4.5 Mobile-critical staff routes (priority order)
1. `wa_inbox` — receptionists on phone
2. `ops_board` — task claim/done on the move
3. `guests` — check-in Slot 1/2
4. `housekeeping_tablet` — cleaner kiosk
5. `App.js` shell — `mobile-bar` (5 items) + hamburger drawer + `main` padding

Guest surfaces (`/portal`, `/inv`) = **out of scope** for this pass.

### 4.6 Real phone
Use for **phase sign-off** on Vercel after push — not every color tweak during `npm start`.

### 4.7 Production URLs
- Frontend: `https://dream-ai-system.vercel.app` (auto from `main`)
- Supabase: `bunohsdggxyyzruubvcd`

---

## 5. UI Upgrade Program — "Staff Wow Effect"

Approved strategy (session 73–74). **Execute in order. Do not skip Phase 0.**

### 5.1 Design invariants (non-negotiable)
- CSS variables: `--ivory`, `--gold`, `--black`, `--card-bg`, `--border` — no new random hex.
- **Disable, Don't Hide** — buttons stay visible; use muted + `title` when invalid.
- **FAIL VISIBLE** — errors shown, not swallowed.
- Staff UX = **scannable + fast**, not heavy animation (see `RESORT_UI_MANIFEST.md` §1.2).
- **No Hebrew label/copy changes** unless Mike explicitly requests.

### 5.2 Corrected file map (common mistakes)

| Prompt said | Reality |
|---|---|
| KPI: Departments / Open Tasks / Checklist | **`Dashboard` in `App.js`** (~lines 1166–1204), `.stat-card` / `.stat-grid` |
| Same KPIs on OperationsBoard | **Wrong** — Ops board has filter chips + `TaskCard` list, not KPI grid |
| "שגר עכשיו" in Inbox | **Wrong** — it's in `AutomationControlCenter.js`; Inbox has `🚀 שלח משימה` |
| OperationsBoard "table rows" | **Wrong** — vertical `TaskCard` cards, not HTML `<table>` |
| AICopilot vs mobile-bar overlap | **Already fixed** session 52 — verify only unless regression |

### 5.3 Phase plan (desktop + mobile per phase)

| Phase | Target | Desktop | Mobile (same phase) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | `App.js` `:root` + global CSS | Tokens + utility classes | `--hit-target-*`, `--safe-bottom-nav`, mobile `@media` touch rules |
| **1** | `WhatsAppInbox.js` | Roster polish, CTAs | Swipe row 48px, reply bar above keyboard, badge nowrap, `isMobile` targets |
| **2a** | `App.js` `Dashboard` | Luxury `.stat-card` | `stat-grid` 2-col at 768px, readable values |
| **2b** | `OperationsBoard.js` | TaskCard breathing room | Full-width cards, chip wrap, claim/done buttons ≥48px |
| **3** | `HousekeepingTabletView.js` | — | 72px fat-finger + jacuzzi tokens (kiosk-first) |
| **3v** | `AICopilot.js` | — | Verify `bottom:88px` ≤768px; no overlap with bar |
| **4** | `App.js` shell + `GuestsPage.js` | Sidebar/hamburger polish | `mobile-bar` tap targets, drawer width, `guests` check-in on 390px |
| **5** | Real device QA | — | Mike signs off on `dream-ai-system.vercel.app` at 390px for routes 1–5 |

**After each phase:** agent posts Desktop OK + **Mobile Checklist** (§5.7) before `continue`.

### 5.4 Optional Phase 6 (later)
- `AutomationControlCenter.js` — tablet 768–1024px overflow (known gap in manifest §3.2)
- `BroadcastDashboard.js` — hex cleanup

### 5.5 Mobile Checklist template (agent fills every phase)

Phase N — Mobile @ 390px / 768px
[ ] No horizontal scroll on primary content
[ ] Primary CTA ≥44px tap height
[ ] Bottom content not hidden under mobile-bar
[ ] Floating widgets (AICopilot) clear of mobile-bar
[ ] Hebrew badges readable, not clipped
[ ] Disabled actions still visible (muted + title)
[ ] npm run build clean


### 5.6 Out of scope for staff UI pass
- `GuestPortal.js`, `PhotoTour.js` — separate guest palette by design
- `InventoryPortal.js` — staff tool, hardcoded hex OK per manifest

### 5.7 Desktop session kickoff prompt (Mike copy-paste — FULL)

See Mike's latest message or §11 — full handoff block maintained in playbook updates.

### 5.8 Phase kickoff prompt (short)

@CLAUDE.md @RESORT_UI_MANIFEST.md @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md
@src/App.js

XOS staff UI — Phase 0 only: design tokens + utility classes in App.js.
CSS vars only. No logic. No Hebrew label changes.
Diagnostic summary of lines to touch BEFORE editing.
Then atomic diff. npm run build. Deploy checklist. Offer deploy.


---

## 6. Mandatory Agent Workflow (every code session)

### 6.0 Session Pipeline (agent auto-routes — Mike need not pick a prompt)

Cursor rule: `.cursor/rules/XOS-Session-Pipeline.mdc`. Full copy-paste prompts: **§8**.

| Stage | When | Output | Stop? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 Research** | "how does X work", unclear ground truth, pre-feature map | Facts table + file:line evidence only — **no code** | Yes — wait |
| **1 Diagnostic** | New feature / non-trivial fix / architecture choice | 3 distinct approaches + exact files/lines + chosen option + reuse/caching notes — **no code** | Yes — wait for `כן`/`yes` |
| **2 Execute** | After Mike confirms Stage 1 (or tiny 1-line bug) | Atomic diffs only + cache invalidation if mutating | Soft — show Mike |
| **3 QA** | After Stage 2 on automation / webhooks / RLS / Shabbat / guest routing | Independent review → P0 list or `PASSED QA` | Soft — before deploy |
| **4 Deploy** | Mike says `תעלה` / `yes deploy` | Checklist layers touched only | Run commands |

**Skip matrix (token-efficient):**
- One-line typo / CSS token / obvious null-check → Stage 2 only (no Research/Diagnostic).
- Pure investigation → Stage 0 only (stop).
- Visual-only staff UI → Stage 1 short file/line list → Stage 2 (UI template §8.4); skip Shabbat QA unless automation touched.
- Mike override: `רק research` / `רק diagnostic` / `תריץ QA` forces that stage.

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/active_sprint.md` + this file.
1b. **Design Mode (= Stage 1):** new feature / architecturally unclear only — skip for small bugfixes. Present **3 distinct approaches** (not 3 variations of the same idea) with trade-offs. Justify chosen option (Disable-Don't-Hide, FAIL VISIBLE). List exact files/lines. Identify reusable helpers first. Wait for Mike to pick / say `כן` before any code.
2. **Plan & Chain of Thought:** For complex logic, Plan → Execute → Verify reasoning *before* writing code.
3. Read target files before editing. **Search existing function/util/`_shared/` first — reuse beats reinventing.**
4. **Execute (Stage 2):** Atomic diffs only. Small focused diffs. Every DB mutation that feeds cached UI → invalidate/update that cache immediately.
5. **Self-Verify — exact match:** Re-read Mike's ask line-by-line vs what shipped. Flag simplifications explicitly.
5b. **External Verify / Independent QA (Stage 3):** High-stakes (migrations, automation, RLS, guest bot, Shabbat) — do not trust self-check alone. Run §8.3 checklist (or spawn fresh Plan agent). Output P0 flaws or `PASSED QA`.
6. `npm run build` before commit when `src/` changed.
7. End with **Deploy Checklist** (only layers touched).
8. **Offer** autonomous deploy; run on `yes` / `כן` / `תעלה`.
9. Update `docs/changelog.md` (1 line) + `CLAUDE.md` if architecture state changed.
10. If process improved → update **this playbook** §9 / §10.

### 6.1 Reset-on-Drift Protocol
If the agent starts inventing unrequested changes, contradicting its own prior statements, or "fixing" things Mike didn't ask about — **stop immediately, do not try to patch it within the same context.** Tell Mike plainly ("איבדתי הקשר / נראה שאני סוטה מהמשימה — כדאי לפתוח שיחה חדשה") and let him start a fresh session. Fighting drift inside a already-confused context window compounds errors instead of fixing them.

### 6.2 QA / Edge Cases
- **Mike names the critical edge cases** for features he cares about (payment, automation gates, guest data) — the agent does not guess which ones matter most.
- The agent implements tests/checks for exactly those cases, then confirms explicitly which ones were covered — not a vague "should work now."
- **Self-review is weak on logic bugs at this codebase's size** (same reason as §6 step 5b) — a model checking its own multi-file change is prone to missing the interaction it just introduced. Treat self-review as a first pass, not the final gate, on anything touching automation/payment/RLS.
- **Always on Stage 3 checklist:** Silence Rule (`needs_callback`/`human_requested` never mute backend); Record-Only ETA; Shabbat guest routing; no duplicate helpers; cache invalidation on mutations.

### Deploy checklist template

| Layer | When | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `src/` or `public/` changed | `git add …` → `git commit -m "…"` → `git push origin main` |
| DB | new `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | `npx supabase db push` |
| Functions | `supabase/functions/` or `_shared/` changed | `npx supabase functions deploy <name> --no-verify-jwt` |

---

## 7. XOS Rules Agents Must Not Break

- `needs_callback` / `human_requested` = **UI alerts only** — never mute bot/cron/webhooks.
- Record-only ETA → `arrival_time` + auto-reply; also `guest_alerts.arrival_eta` for Requests Board (no ops tasks / needs_callback / red-dot).
- Suite management routing → `120363429859248777@g.us` + English translation for staff cards.
- Never touch `.env`.
- Never modify Hebrew UI strings unless Mike explicitly asks.
- `.maybeSingle()` not `.single()` on Supabase reads.
- **Strict Code Constraints:** Do NOT add unrequested code comments. Do NOT rename existing functions unless explicitly instructed.
- **No Auto-Piloting:** the agent never runs `git commit`/`git push`, `db push`, or `functions deploy` without Mike's explicit approval word (§2.1/§12) — this is absolute, not a suggestion. Local, non-mutating commands (`npm run build`, reading files, `npm test`) do not require approval. Only one phase/part of a plan is worked on at a time — finish it, show Mike, wait — never run ahead into the next part unprompted.

---

## 8. Prompt Templates (copy-paste for Mike)

**Default:** describe the task in one line — the agent auto-routes via §6.0. Use these only to force a role or paste Stage-3 QA on a finished diff.

### 8.1 Research (read-only ground truth)

```
@CLAUDE.md @docs/active_sprint.md @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md
Role: Read-Only Research Agent for XOS.
Task: Extract absolute ground truth regarding [TOPIC — e.g. Shabbat routing in whatsapp-send].
Constraints:
1. DO NOT write or propose any code modifications.
2. Scan file structure + migration history; cite exact file names and line numbers.
3. Output a concise table of facts and evidence only.
```

### 8.2 Architect — TWO-PART (Diagnostic then Execute)

```
@CLAUDE.md @docs/active_sprint.md @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md
Zero pleasantries. Jump straight to technical execution.
ROLE: Lead Software Architect for XOS (token-efficient).
TASK: [one-line feature/fix]

PART 1 — DIAGNOSTIC (READ-ONLY):
1. No code blocks yet.
2. Brainstorm 3 distinct architectural alternatives.
3. For each: exact files + lines to touch.
4. Justify chosen option (Disable-Don't-Hide, FAIL VISIBLE).
5. Name existing reusable helpers to avoid duplication.
6. If heavy DB reads: Strategic Caching + TTL.
Output Part 1, STOP, wait for כן / yes.

PART 2 — EXECUTE (only after confirmation):
1. Atomic diffs only (2–3 lines context). NEVER dump full files.
2. Any INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on cached UI data → invalidate cache immediately.
3. No new CSS vars outside :root; no Hebrew label changes.
4. Self-QA incl. Shabbat guest edge cases.
5. Autopilot Deploy Checklist + 1-line docs/changelog.md.
```

### 8.2b Short Diagnostic-only (when Research facts already pasted)

```
@CLAUDE.md @docs/active_sprint.md
Facts from research: [paste Stage 0 table]
PART 1 — Diagnostic FIRST: exact files/lines to touch. No code. Wait for כן.
PART 2 — Execute only after confirmation: atomic diffs + caching constraints.
```

### 8.3 Independent QA (after Atomic Diffs)

```
@CLAUDE.md
Role: Independent Senior QA & Code Reviewer for XOS.
Task: Audit these code changes:
[paste Atomic Diffs]

Verify strictly:
1. Duplicate functions / Reusability violations?
2. Silence Rule, Record-Only ETA, or other XOS operational rules broken?
3. Cache invalidation if DB mutations?
4. Saturday/Shabbat guest edge-case failures?

Output: list of P0 flaws OR reply "PASSED QA".
```

### 8.4 UI/UX Specialist (visual only)

```
@CLAUDE.md @src/App.js @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md
Role: XOS UI/UX Specialist.
Task: Upgrade visual layout of [SCREEN/COMPONENT].
Constraints:
1. ONLY existing :root CSS variables (--gold, --ivory, etc.).
2. Do NOT touch backend routing, DB fetches, or Hebrew labels.
3. Responsive: Desktop 1280px + Mobile 390px.
4. Preserve Disable-Don't-Hide + FAIL VISIBLE.
Diagnostic file/line list first; wait for כן before diffs.
```

### 8.5 Short envelopes

| Need | Paste |
|---|---|
| Bug | `@CLAUDE.md` Bug: [what] on [route]. Expected: [line]. Minimal fix. Deploy checklist. |
| Deploy | `yes deploy` / `תעלה` |
| Hebrew short | Reply: Hebrew, max 15 lines. |
| Force stage | `רק research` / `רק diagnostic` / `תריץ QA` |


---

## 9. Living Document — Auto-Improve Protocol

When any session discovers a **durable lesson**, the closing agent MUST:

1. Add a dated bullet to **§10 Learnings Log** below.
2. Add 1 line to `docs/changelog.md`.
3. If it changes how agents work → update §2–§8 in this file.
4. If it changes architecture → update `CLAUDE.md`.
5. If sprint priority changed → update `docs/active_sprint.md`.

**Do not** let knowledge live only in chat — chat is lost; files persist.

---

## 10. Learnings Log

### 2026-07-21 — Full `deno test` sweep (not just the touched file) caught 5 real, silently-broken bugs from the last 2 days
- **Trigger:** Mike asked for a health scan after a transient `automation-queue` network error made him suspicious of recent sessions. Running the full `_shared` suite (515 tests) instead of only the files a given prior commit touched surfaced 5 real regressions across 4 files, none caught before commit: a syntax error in `oritSigalGuide.test.ts` (a stray `});` left the whole file's 5 tests silently never running — `deno test` errors out on a parse failure before executing anything, which looks identical to "no tests found" if you don't check exit status), a Hebrew `\b`-after-Hebrew-letter regex bug reintroduced in a brand-new pattern despite the exact same bug class already being documented elsewhere in the same file (2026-07-07's "מים" fix), a booking-merge heuristic (`isSameDoc2Booking`) that let phone+date override an explicit order-number mismatch, a global-flag regex (`^(re|fwd?|fw):`) that can't repeat because `^` only anchors once even with `/g`, and an intent-classifier check-order bug where a broad pattern (`תזמן|תזמני`) shadowed a more specific one (`כן תזמני`) checked later.
- **General lesson:** Running only the test file for the module you just edited is not enough — a change in one shared module (e.g. `automationSchedule.ts`'s new `missing_phone` gate) breaks unrelated modules' *existing* fixtures with zero edit to those files. Periodically run the entire `_shared` suite (`deno test --no-check --allow-env <all *.test.ts except ezgoMailImap.test.ts, which needs a real `npm install` for `imapflow`>`) and triage every failure by git-blaming the touched production file/line, not just the test — most failures were 1-2 days old, not ancient baseline noise, and each had a concrete, low-risk one-line fix.
- **What was deliberately NOT touched:** `oritScheduleSend.test.ts` still fails 2/2 — `ISRAEL_UTC_OFFSET_HOURS = 2` is a documented "fixed UTC+2, no DST" simplification used throughout `automationSchedule.ts` for schedule-instant math, while `formatOritScheduleLabel` displays via real DST-aware `Intl`/`toLocaleString`. During Israel's DST season (roughly Apr–Oct, i.e. now) this makes any Orit-scheduled send land 1 real-world hour later than the label shown to Sigal. This is a system-wide architectural tradeoff, not a local bug — flagged to Mike for a Stage 1 Diagnostic decision rather than patched solo.

### 2026-07-21 — `status='checked_in'` alone is not proof a guest is physically in the room
- **Symptom:** A drink-request ops task (`בקשת משקה לחדר`) went out to «אוניקס 7» ops group for a guest whose own `arrival_date` was 2 days in the future — nobody was in the room yet.
- **Root:** `isGuestEligibleForInHouseOpsDispatch` (`_shared/automationSchedule.ts`) trusted `status==="checked_in"` unconditionally, with zero date sanity check — only the `pending`/`expected`/`room_ready` branch checked `arrival_date`/`departure_date`. A guest whose dates were corrected (re-import/edit) after an earlier housekeeping check-in event kept a stale `checked_in` flag from the old dates.
- **Fix pattern:** even the `checked_in` branch now requires `!arrival_date || arrival_date <= today`. Single choke point (`isGuestEligibleForInHouseOpsDispatch`) — used by Meta Tier-0, Meta LLM-tool path (`classifyGuestRequestDispatch`), Whapi Tier-0, and both channels' departure-assist intercept — so the guard covers all 6+ call sites for free. Guests failing the check still route gracefully to `requests_board` (existing future-guest path), never silently dropped.
- **General lesson:** any "is guest physically present" gate keyed off a status enum needs to also sanity-check the stay-date window, not just trust the status value — statuses can go stale when dates are edited after the fact without a matching status revert.

### 2026-07-22 — EZGO IMAP sync: envelope-first dedup before postal-mime; never download 36 full bodies every tick
- **Symptom:** Manual «סרוק מייל» hit `IMAP timeout — נסה שוב בעוד דקה` (~55s budget); user waited for `noreply@ezgo.co.il` reports that never appeared.
- **Root:** Each sync downloaded full RFC822 `source` for up to 36 allowlisted UIDs **plus** a supplement that pulled full bodies from the last ~60 mailbox messages (filtering by From only after download). Re-parsed every known ingest with `postal-mime` on every cron tick. EZGO mail cron was gated behind `CRON_ENABLED`, so background ingest stopped when outbound was halted.
- **Fix pattern:** Two-phase IMAP — `envelope` + `Message-ID` first, compare to `ezgo_mail_ingest.external_message_id`, download `source` only for new allowlisted mail. Gmail search scoped with `newer_than:7d` (`EZGO_MAIL_SEARCH_DAYS`). Supplement = envelope-only recent scan (~28 msgs), not full-body blast. Run `ezgo-mail-sync` from `whatsapp-cron` **before** the outbound kill switch. UI: Supabase realtime INSERT on `ezgo_mail_ingest` + 90s poll (list refresh only — no auto IMAP).

### 2026-07-20 — Hand-rolled MIME regex parsing breaks on real Gmail forwards; use a real parser
- **Symptom:** `ezgo-mail-sync` found forwarded Operations emails via IMAP (mailbox scan worked) but every one landed as `skipped`/0 rows — the EZGO HTML table never made it out of the raw message source.
- **Root:** `extractBodiesFromSource` hand-parsed MIME with regex (boundary splitting, manual quoted-printable/base64 decode). This is fragile against real-world Gmail forwards: nested multipart (`multipart/mixed` → `multipart/related` → `multipart/alternative`), inline images, and occasionally the original message forwarded as a raw `message/rfc822` part rather than inlined HTML — none of which a single regex pass reliably survives.
- **Fix pattern:** Replaced the regex parser with `npm:postal-mime` (works natively in Deno, zero Node-specific deps) — `PostalMime.parse(rawBytes)` returns decoded `.html`/`.text` directly, and correctly recurses into `message/rfc822` attachments when needed. Don't hand-roll MIME/RFC822 parsing for anything that has to survive real mail clients' quirks (Gmail, Outlook, forwards, nested parts) — always reach for a maintained parser library first.

### 2026-07-20 — `supabase functions deploy` bundles the disk, not git — uncommitted `_shared` changes ride along silently
- **Symptom:** Deploying `whapi-webhook` for an unrelated feature (spa upsell offer) also uploaded `_shared/oritGuestOutbound.ts`, `oritAgentOritDecision.ts`, and `oritAgentAi.ts` — files with substantial uncommitted edits from a prior, unfinished session (96 insertions / 55 deletions), because `whapi-webhook` imports them.
- **Root:** The CLI reads the current working tree, not `git status` or `HEAD` — every transitive `_shared` import gets bundled regardless of commit state. There is no warning when a deploy target's dependency graph includes dirty files unrelated to the task at hand.
- **Fix pattern:** Before deploying any function, check `git status` for modified `_shared/*` files and, if any appear that aren't part of the current task, flag them to Mike explicitly rather than deploying silently — he may want to review/revert them first. `git stash`-ing unrelated dirty files before a deploy (then popping after) is the safe move when the risk is real; for low-risk/legible diffs, disclosure after the fact is the minimum bar.

### 2026-07-20 — A settings panel that `select("*")`s a table must never blind-upsert the whole map back
- **Symptom found while scoping a fix, not from a bug report:** `BotConfigPanel.js` fetches every `bot_config` row (`select("*")`, all categories) into one `config` map so it can render three tabs, but `handleSave` re-upserted `Object.values(config)` — every row, including categories the panel never displays (e.g. `restaurant_kiosk_ui`, `guest_club_ui`). Any admin saving Persona/Knowledge/Rules silently rewrote unrelated settings rows with their already-loaded (usually unchanged) values.
- **Why it mattered here:** adding a RESTRICTIVE RLS policy to lock one `config_key` to `super_admin` only (migration 262, shift-manager kiosk PIN) would have broken every `admin`-role save in this panel, since the batched upsert statement fails atomically if RLS rejects any single row in it.
- **Fix pattern:** scope the save payload to the categories the panel actually owns (`rows.filter(item => CATEGORIES.some(c => c.id === item.category))`) before upserting. Any panel that loads a superset of a table for convenience must write back only the subset it's actually responsible for.

### 2026-07-19 — Automation trusts `guests.room`, not `room_type` alone
- **Symptom:** Premium Day guests received suite stages (`night_before`, `morning_suite`); guests with `room_type=suite` but empty `room` entered suite cron.
- **Root:** `isEffectiveSuiteGuest` treated `room_type === "suite"` as sufficient; Premium Day 1/2 not recognized server-side; no `missing_room_assignment` gate.
- **Fix pattern:** `_shared/suiteNames.ts` — suite = `isCanonicalSuiteRoom(room)` only; day-pass = `isPremiumDayRoom` OR `day_guest`+non-empty room; `getMissingRoomAssignmentSkipReason` in `checkEligibility` + `whatsapp-send` (exempt manual/room_ready). Mirror in `pipelineSegment.js` + `guestTiming.js`.

### 2026-07-17 — Stage 1 had two invisible text sources (Meta vs bot_scripts)
- **Symptom:** Guest received «סופרים את הימים» from Whapi but ACC script editor showed different copy; CTA «כן, מגיעים» appeared without admin writing it.
- **Root:** Hybrid pipeline — Whapi reads `bot_scripts.pre_arrival_2d`, Meta reads `dream_arrival_confirmation`; `ensureArrivalConfirmationCta` appended silently on Whapi only.
- **Fix pattern:** Option 2 — ACC Stage 1 «מקור האמת» panel + true outbound preview (`Stage1ArrivalPanel` / `stage1ArrivalCopy.js`); toggle `bot_config.stage1_auto_append_cta`; keep `isArrivalConfirmationMessage` unchanged for intelligent inbound match.

### 2026-07-17 — Guest bot "one brain" = one prompt assembler + one context builder, not just shared DB rows
- **Whapi DM spam:** inbound dedupe (`wa_message_id`) alone does not stop N auto-replies when Whapi delivers N distinct IDs in a burst. Meta had burst coalescing; Whapi did not until `_shared/guestInboundBurst.ts`. Belt: 120s outbound body cooldown on `sendGuestDmReply`.
- **Duplicate fallback prompts are live contradictions, not tech debt:** Meta's local `buildSystemPrompt` vs Whapi's `guestBotPrompt.ts` produced different handoff sentences and hours when `bot_settings.system_prompt` was empty — guests on different channels got different answers for the same FAQ. Fix: delete the local fallback entirely; both channels call `assembleGuestBrainPrompt` only.
- **Inbox-unified ≠ LLM-unified until history is merged:** UI already showed one thread per phone, but each webhook still fed the model only its own `inbox_channel` history — cross-channel amnesia. `fetchGuestChatHistory({ channel: "unified" })` is the minimal fix before pgvector RAG.
- **Tier-0 parity is a checklist, not a comment:** Whapi's header comment said operational routing wasn't ported while the code already had it; balloon/admin were the real gaps. Extract intercepts to `_shared` and wire both adapters — don't copy-paste Meta blocks into Whapi again.

### 2026-07-16 — Staff Group Analytics: chitchat is data, not noise
- **Webhook POST auth (2026-07-16):** Meta POST must pass `X-Hub-Signature-256` (`META_APP_SECRET`); Whapi POST must carry `X-Whapi-Secret` matching `WHAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (configure via Whapi `PATCH /settings` → `webhooks[].headers`). Both fail closed if secret missing — deploy secrets *before* functions or traffic stops. Bypass only for local sim: `WHATSAPP_SIMULATION` / `WHAPI_WEBHOOK_SKIP_AUTH`.
- **Split "presence" from "operational impact"** — message share ≠ work done. `teamOpsAnalytics.ts` reports both: presence from `staff_group_messages`, operational share from `tasks` + `housekeeping_wa_events` + 👍 reactions. Executive assistant answers with `get_team_ops_analytics`, not raw SQL.
- **Historical presence is forward-only** — tasks/HK events are backfillable; message presence starts at deploy. Tool must say so (`coverageNote`) to avoid CEO trusting a partial %.

### 2026-07-15 — Cursor writes, Claude Code verifies (handoff saves tokens)
- **Standing workflow (Mike-approved):** Cursor/Composer implements features + atomic diffs; Claude Code receives a **short handoff** (file list, test commands, deploy checklist — not full chat history), reads ground-truth files, runs `deno test`, fixes slips (e.g. missing `useState`, stale test assertions), then deploys only on explicit `תעלה`/`yes`.
- **Handoff template:** Goal (1 para) → Files to read → Tests to run → Deploy commands → Do NOT mix (unrelated uncommitted paths) → Manual QA phrases.
- **Real slips caught this way (Adir session):** `ExecutivePlaybook.js` used `log`/`logLoading` without `useState` (would crash render); `executiveAssistant.test.ts` still asserted old Eliad overlay heading after persona rename.
- **Token rule:** Cursor stops before long deploy/log loops; Claude Code owns terminal verification. Neither agent re-explains the whole architecture in the handoff.

### 2026-07-13 — Whapi ban → always need a Dream Bot SOS; and "fix deployed" isn't "fix landed before the damage"
- **New standing rule:** any time guest outbound depends on one physical Whapi device (Suites number), there must be a documented, flaggable SOS fallback to Meta Dream Bot that does not require a code deploy to activate — WhatsApp itself can restrict/ban a device (spam/automated-message detection) with no warning, and the ban clock (~17h observed) is outside our control. `WHAPI_GUEST_SOS_META` (checked inside `isGuestWhapiSuitesEnabled()` itself, not a parallel gate) is that lever now; keep it working for every future Whapi-routed guest trigger, not just the ones that existed on 2026-07-13.
- **Fold the emergency switch into the existing single choke point, don't add a second one:** `guestWhapiRouting.ts`'s `isGuestWhapiSuitesEnabled()` already had ~10 callers (incl. `room_ready`'s direct read, which bypasses the suite/day-pass classifier entirely). Rather than auditing and editing every call site to also check a new SOS flag, the SOS check went inside that one function — every caller inherited the fallback for free, and the test matrix could assert coverage of the "bypasses the classifier" case directly instead of trusting it by inspection.
- **"The fix is deployed" needs a timestamp, not just a git commit, to explain an incident:** the retry-storm fix (Phase B, previous entry below) was already committed and marked "✅ Deployed" in `active_sprint.md` before this session started. That was true but incomplete — `npx supabase functions list` showed `whatsapp-cron`'s actual deploy timestamp (08:38:20 UTC) landed *after* the last failed retry in the storm (08:32 UTC), which a direct `notification_log` query (`npx supabase db query --linked`, read-only) showed ran 493 failed attempts across 40 guests for `morning_welcome` alone, every ~15 min for 3+ hours. Git history proves code correctness; only the deployed-function timestamp proves *when* that correctness became live traffic. When forensically explaining "why did X happen," cross-check both, not just the commit log.
- **A scope estimate from a comment/description is a starting point, not a fact — verify by reading the code:** Mike's ask (and `automationClaim.ts`'s own header comment) named 4 remaining fast paths for Phase C claim-before-send (`night_before`, `morning_suite`/`morning_welcome`, `room_ready`, `stage_2_arrival`). Grepping the actual dispatch code found `morning_welcome` alone has 3 independent dispatch blocks (day-pass Meta fast-path, Whapi/force session block, Shabbat template block) — 6 blocks total, not 4. Surfaced this to Mike before touching any of them (via `AskUserQuestion`, not a silent assumption) since the real root cause (Phase B) was already confirmed fixed and this narrower race-condition guard wasn't urgent — he chose to defer it to a calmer session rather than rush 6 edits to hot guest-messaging code under incident pressure. When a fix touches "the same pattern in N places," count N from the code, not from the bug report or a code comment written before the current state of the file.
- **A temporary diagnostic function is still live infrastructure until someone deletes it:** `debug-whapi-diag/index.ts` was self-documented "TEMPORARY... delete after diagnosis" but stayed deployed and untracked in git after its one use (confirming the channel was in `QR` state). Untracked + deployed is an easy thing to lose track of — grep `git status` for stray untracked function directories as part of any Whapi/incident session, not just at the very end.

### 2026-07-13 — Retry-storm fix: timeout≠retry-forever, and "the one shared gate" is not always literally one gate
- **Root pattern:** `guests.msg_*_sent` and `notification_log`'s sent/simulated dedup are BOTH stamped/checked exclusively on confirmed success — a `timeout`/`failed`/`blocked_by_meta` attempt writes an audit row but latches nothing, so `whatsapp-cron` re-queues the same guest+trigger every ~15 min forever. Fix: a small pure module (`_shared/automationRetryGate.ts`) precomputes a per-(guest, stage_key) retry state from a batched `notification_log` read (same pattern as the existing `pipeline_suppressed_stages` attach), and a single `evaluateRetryGate` call inside `checkEligibility` gates it — `cooldown` after 1 failure, `exhausted` after N. Because `checkEligibility` is already the one function `whatsapp-cron` and `automation-queue` both call, every trigger type got the fix with zero per-trigger duplication and `force:true`/ACC Override was untouched by construction (it never goes through `checkEligibility` at all).
- **"One shared gate" had a second door:** `stage_2_arrival` is `schedule_mode='event_immediate'` and is deliberately excluded from the main `checkEligibility` due-loop scan (fires from `whatsapp-webhook` on confirmation, not cron polling) — but `whatsapp-cron` also runs a SEPARATE reconcile pass for it (catches confirmed-but-never-sent guests) that never calls `checkEligibility` either. QA (cold re-read against Mike's own "cron cannot 15m-spam" checklist item) caught that this second path was completely unprotected by the new gate. Lesson: before declaring "the one choke point" fixes everything, grep for every OTHER place that pushes onto the same `due[]`/dispatch queue — a stage excluded from the main scan for a good reason (event-driven, not polled) can still have its own bespoke re-queue logic that needs the identical latch wired in separately.
- **`blocked_by_meta` is the same failure class as `timeout`/`failed`, easy to forget:** initial implementation only counted `timeout`/`failed` toward cooldown/exhaustion. `blocked_by_meta` has the identical "flag never stamped → cron re-queues forever" mechanism and is literally the status from the 2026-07-12 day-pass `#131008`/`#132000` template-rejection loop (CLAUDE.md §1) — a past incident, not a hypothetical. When building a "why didn't this flag/latch happen" gate, enumerate every status value that skips the success-only stamp, not just the one status name in the current bug report.
- **Claim-before-send reused a dormant schema value instead of a new table:** `notification_log.status` already had `'processing'` reserved in its CHECK constraint (migration 139) with nothing writing it. A single partial unique index (`WHERE status='processing'`, same pattern as the existing sent/simulated dedup index from migrations 006/088) made "one in-flight attempt per guest+trigger" a Postgres-enforced invariant with no new table, and claim→finalize became UPDATE-the-same-row (not a second INSERT), so retries never flood `notification_log`/Inbox with duplicate rows. Before adding a table for a new state-tracking need, check whether an existing status enum already reserved a value for it.
- **`deno check` delta review caught a real bug, not just noise:** the anti-spam module's own first-draft test suite exposed that `buildRetryStateMap` tracked `lastAttemptAt` across ALL passed-in rows, not just the failure-status ones — meaning a caller that ever passed an unfiltered batch (mixing in a `sent` row) would silently corrupt the cooldown timestamp. Both current callers happen to pre-filter, so this wasn't yet live, but the function was hardened to filter internally too (defense in depth) rather than trusting every future caller to remember. A failing test in your own new code is worth chasing to a source fix, not just adjusting the assertion to match current behavior.

### 2026-07-13 — Guest Experience Survey: fixed-UTC+2 test helper vs real-DST `israelLocalHour` near a boundary minute
- **Symptom:** Two new Deno tests failed (`survey_invite_daypass` "before 17:00" asserted `dueNow=false` but got `true`; `spa_warmup_daypass` sane-hours check expected a skip but got none) — investigated as a suspected production bug for ~20 minutes before finding the real cause.
- **Root:** `automationSchedule.ts`'s anchor/target-date math (`utcHourToTimestamp`, `parseLocalTimeToUtcHour`, new `israelLocalDateTimeToUtc`) is *intentionally* fixed-UTC+2, no DST (documented, accepted). But the actual "is it due right now" gate (`isDueByIsraelLocalClock` → `israelLocalHour`) reads the *real* IANA-DST-aware clock. During Israel's real DST season (~late March–late October, includes every reference date this test file already used), the two conventions differ by exactly 1 real hour. The test file's own `israelInstant()` helper builds "now" via the same fixed-UTC+2 convention as the anchor math — correct for anything compared only against other fixed-offset values, but wrong when the assertion is a boundary-minute check against `israelLocalHour` (real clock). Existing 27 tests never hit this because they all used comfortable multi-hour margins around their thresholds, not minute-precision boundary assertions.
- **Not a production bug:** verified via a throwaway script (`_debug_spa.ts` in `supabase/functions/`, deleted after) — production's actual due-now decision already uses the real-DST-aware path, so live sends fire at true Israel wall-clock time regardless of this test-construction nuance.
- **Fix pattern:** when writing a new Deno test against a `day_offset_with_time`/local-hour-gated stage, never assert at an exact boundary minute (`local_time` ± a few minutes) — pick values with a full-hour-plus margin either side, matching every pre-existing test in `automationSchedule.test.ts`. If a boundary must be tested precisely, construct "now" via the real IANA offset for that specific date instead of the codebase's fixed-UTC+2 shorthand.
- **General lesson:** when a new test fails against otherwise-correct-looking logic, write a tiny throwaway script that calls the real functions directly and prints intermediate values (anchor instant, computed local hour) *before* concluding the production code is wrong — two rounds of hand-tracing the arithmetic on paper both reached the wrong conclusion here; the throwaway script found the real cause in one run.

### 2026-07-13 — Whapi-first guest outbound: single choke point + a TS narrowing trap
- **Single choke point found, not assumed:** `whatsapp-send`'s generic `if (forceMetaTemplate && trigger !== "night_before")` branch (one early `if`, well before any per-trigger block) turned out to already intercept EVERY manual `force_channel=meta_template` request except `night_before` — including `room_ready` and `morning_suite`/`morning_welcome`, whose own later trigger-specific blocks never run for a forced-Meta request at all. One Phase-3 hard-fail guard placed there (+ one more in `night_before`'s own separate `force_channel` switch) covered all triggers — didn't need to touch room_ready/morning's own code. Lesson: before assuming a fix needs N call sites, trace whether an early generic branch already short-circuits most of them.
- **`a?.b || a?.c` as an `if` condition silently narrows `a` to non-null inside the block** — removing that condition (to fix a Whapi FAIL VISIBLE fallthrough gap) reintroduced a `'stageRow' is possibly null` TS error on a later unguarded `stageRow.x` access that had relied on it. `deno check`'s before/after delta caught it immediately; simplifying a compound optional-chaining condition is not free even when the condition itself looks redundant.
- **Verify by diffing deno-check error counts, not by trusting a single `deno check` run** — this codebase carries ~37-118 pre-existing type errors per Edge Function (Supabase client generic mismatches, mostly). A raw error count means nothing; stash/diff (or a `git show HEAD:file` copy in a temp dir — safer than `git stash`, which risks sweeping up unrelated uncommitted work) against baseline is the only way to know if a change actually introduced something new.

### 2026-07-12 — Day-pass still on Meta while suites on Whapi → cron alert loop
- **Symptom:** Admin Whapi alert every ~15m for «ליאור ורותי חזיזה» — `meta_template_400` #131008 URL button / earlier #132000 on `dream_checkin_reminder_v2`.
- **Root:** Guest is `day_guest` (Premium Day). `shouldRouteGuestOutboundViaWhapiSuites` was suite-only, so `night_before_daypass` kept calling Meta; broken template never stamped `msg_pre_arrival_sent` → infinite cron retry.
- **Fix pattern:** When `GUEST_WHAPI_SUITES_ENABLED`, route **suite + day-pass** outbound via Whapi session scripts; skip Meta day-pass morning fast-path. Do not assume "Whapi = all guests" without checking `room_type` in the log.

### 2026-07-12 — Session pipeline: Research → Diagnostic → Execute → QA (agent routes)
- **Problem:** Mike had 4 strong role-prompts but no single place that said when each runs; copy-pasting every time wasted tokens and risked skipping Diagnostic/QA.
- **Decision:** Playbook §6.0 + §8 full templates + thin alwaysApply rule `XOS-Session-Pipeline.mdc`. Agent auto-routes by task type; Mike overrides with `רק research` / `רק diagnostic` / `תריץ QA`.
- **Not chosen:** Fat always-on rule (token noise on tiny bugs) or 4 separate Skills (duplicate of §8 until Mike asks).

### 2026-07-12 — Callback invert: «תחזרו אלי» → bot says «תוכלו ליצור קשר»
- **Symptom:** Guest asked staff to get back to them to schedule spa; bot replied asking the guest to initiate contact.
- **Root:** Meta `detectHumanRequest` only flagged Inbox red-dot and still ran FAQ→LLM; Whapi had no detector at all. Prompt alone cannot prevent polarity inversion.
- **Fix pattern:** Shared Tier-0 in `_shared/guestBotHandoff.ts` (`detectGuestHumanRequest` + `GUEST_CALLBACK_ACK_SENTENCE`) on both channels before LLM; never ask the guest to contact us when they asked for a callback. Soft SLA already knows `call`/`chat`.

### 2026-07-12 — «בקשות אורחים» group ≠ English field-ops
- **Symptom:** Whapi guest-request pings were English ("GUEST REQUEST… Please check the Requests Board") with no way to open the chat.
- **Root:** `guestAlertWhapiNotify` reused field-ops card style + `translateTextForFieldOps` (HE→EN). That group is Hebrew reception.
- **Fix pattern:** Hebrew headlines (match RequestsBoard labels), keep stored message language, deep-link via existing `?page=wa_inbox&phone=` / `?page=requests_board`. Never HE→EN-translate staff-facing reception groups.

### 2026-07-12 — Stage 1 late-import deadlock (date_passed hide)
- **Symptom:** Tomorrow suite arrivals showed Stage 2 «ממתין לאישור הגעה» with no Stage 1 row and no Send — guests synced after T-2 never got the confirm ask.
- **Root:** `resolveStageSchedule` returned `date_passed` for past day_offset windows; `automation-queue` treated it as `PERMANENT_SKIP` and omitted the row. Stage 2 correctly waits forever with nothing to unlock it.
- **Fix pattern:** distinguish permanent past (`date_passed`, arrival already over) from catch-up (`missed_window`, arrival still today/future, `dueNow=false`); surface catch-up in Live Queue for manual/Whapi bulk. Never hide a still-actionable pipeline stage behind a permanent skip.

### 2026-07-12 — Ezgo Spa Activities: English machine CSV ≠ Hebrew UI export
- **Symptom:** Dropping the real "פעילות ספא….csv" into Spa Board would fail every row (`no_time_range` / no phone / no room).
- **Root:** Parser was built for Hebrew UI headers (`תזמון`/`פעילות`/`טלפון`). Production export is English machine CSV (`tmStart`/`sActivityDesc`/`sTel`/`iAddsLineId`). Also: `iAddsLineId` is shared by both therapists on a couple booking; blanket room GiST forbade 2 overlapping appointments in couple rooms; aliases missing `סוויטת אבניו 2/3/4` and `טרקלין -חדר זוגי`.
- **Fix pattern:** canonicalize English → Hebrew keys in the parser; `ezgo_line_id = iAddsLineId_sRowNum`; skip `iLineStatus=0` with a visible count; couple rooms = max 2 overlapping (single rooms keep hard GiST); seed aliases from the first real file, never guess (`ג'קוזי 1` still unmapped). Prefer file `dtDate` over the UI date picker when unanimous.

### 2026-07-12 — Ezgo CSV `בע"מ` + Latin nickname vs Golden Profile
- **Symptom:** Import of `תפעול ספא 13.7.csv` left ~131 unmatched "שעה לא תקינה" / "אורח לא ידוע"; re-import still lost rows; couples named `limor (לימור סולומון)` missed the existing guest.
- **Root:** (1) Ezgo leaves unescaped ASCII `"` inside `בע"מ` fields — SheetJS merges/drops subsequent rows (ZERO DATA LOSS). (2) Matching used only the outer `guest_name` token, not the Hebrew person in parentheses. (3) No bulk dismiss for staging rows.
- **Fix pattern:** `repairEzgoCsvText` (בע"מ→בע״מ) before any CSV parse; normalize Excel-serial dates + numeric phones; `collectGuestNameHints` / `resolveSpaGuestDisplayName` prefer Hebrew paren person and skip org labels; SpaBoard «נקה הכל» on `spa_import_unmatched`. Always validate against the real daily file, not a synthetic 2-row fixture alone.

### 2026-07-12 — Autonomous audit found uncommitted work-in-progress first
- **Lesson:** before starting a fresh audit/fix pass, always run `git status`/`git diff --stat` first — a prior session's fully-tested, documented fix (departure-assist grounding, 22/22 tests, changelog entry already written as "not deployed") was sitting uncommitted. Verifying and shipping that is higher-value than re-auditing the same ground from scratch.
- **`.single()` audit pattern:** grep for `.single()` across webhook files is a fast, cheap first pass for the hard CLAUDE.md rule — found one real instance (`whapi-webhook` group-task insert) that PostgREST would surface as an error object (not a JS throw) on an RLS select-back gap, so it wasn't crashing visibly but was silently mislabeling a created task as a failure.
- **Sanitize-firewall parity checks by grep count are misleading** — `sanitizeGuestBotReply` grepped 0 hits in `whapi-webhook/index.ts` but is actually enforced via `generateGuestChatReply` in `_shared/guestBotLlm.ts`, which every Whapi guest-DM LLM reply routes through. Always trace the actual call chain, not just occurrence counts, before flagging a parity gap.

### 2026-07-11 — ETA on Requests Board (not Eliad push)
- **Product:** Captured ETA → `guests.arrival_time` + `guest_alerts` (`arrival_eta` / «🕐 שעת הגעה»). Profile chip synced. No ops task / needs_callback / Inbox red-dot.
- **Eliad reports:** Resort digest voiced as personal assistant; digest-relevant learned rules appended; footer invites «תזכרי ש…».

### 2026-07-11 — ETA «רשמתי לפניי» without DB write
- **Symptom:** Guest «מתכננות להגיע ב-12:00» got exact Record-Only reply; `arrival_time` stayed empty.
- **Root:** Tier-0 regex covered `מתכננת`/`מתכננים` but not feminine plural `מתכננות` or `להגיע ב-HH:MM` — LLM fell through and parroted the canned phrase. Also: `בסביבות N` needed `\s*` before digit; DATE_CHANGE used `תאריכ` and never matched final-kaf `תאריך`.
- **Fix pattern:** gender-complete forms + `להגיע ב[-–]?\d` + hourWord spaces; never trust LLM copy as proof of persist. Morning roster = GuestsPage ETA board only (no Whapi push to Eliad).

### 2026-07-11 — Whapi guest bot prompt leak (rules quiz)
- **Symptom:** Suites DM replied with quoted system rules + `Yes` instead of Hebrew concierge copy.
- **Root:** (1) Meta had `sanitizeReply`; Whapi `guestBotLlm` only checked ```/THOUGHT — Hebrew instruction regurgitation passed; (2) Gemini priming `הבנת…ענה כן` can continue as a rules quiz; (3) ETA Tier-0 missed `מתכננת להגיע`/`לקראת` so the message hit the LLM.
- **Fix pattern:** one shared `_shared/guestBotSanitize.ts` on both channels; empty/leak → handoff; never assume Meta firewall covers Whapi.

### 2026-07-11 — Executive voice: Inbox reply ≠ WhatsApp delivery
- **Symptom:** Voice note to Mike/Eliad personal assistant → answer visible in XOS Inbox, nothing on WhatsApp.
- **Root:** (1) outbound logged even when `sendWhapiText` threw; (2) slow voice+LLM → Whapi webhook retry → `claimed:false` skipped executive handler.
- **Fix pattern:** dedicated `deliverExecutiveDmReply` (chat_id first, retry, FAIL VISIBLE); on unclaimed retry re-enter executive path only if no successful outbound yet (`wa_message_id` not null).

### 2026-07-11 — Whapi «קח שיחה» mute broken by Meta claim leak
- **Symptom:** Claim mute works on Dream Bot; Suites (Whapi) bot keeps auto-replying after 🙋.
- **Root:** Inbox guest-map sync (`syncInboxContactWithGuestMap` / `reconcileMessageWithGuestMap`) always wrote `guests.claimed_by` onto every contact — Whapi badge lied (Meta ✓ / wiped Whapi claim). Separately, claim without `guestId` could INSERT a stub while `whapi-webhook` mute-checks the real guest via `resolveGuestByInboundPhone`.
- **Fix pattern:** Whapi claim UI state only from `guest_channel_claims` (ready flag so empty Map doesn't wipe); phone lookup before stub; never copy Meta `claimed_by` onto `inbox_channel=whapi`.

### 2026-07-11 — Whapi Inbox `timeout_no_response` ≠ failed send
- **Symptom:** Red Inbox error `whapi_timeout: …within 25s — message may have still been delivered` on Suites-device replies; staff tempted to resend.
- **Root:** Whapi gate sometimes exceeds the AbortSignal window after WhatsApp already accepted the message. Code correctly refuses Meta fallback on timeout (duplicate risk).
- **Fix pattern:** raise Whapi outbound timeout (45s); UI must say Hebrew «לא ודאי…בדקו לפני שליחה חוזרת», never dump English provider strings as a hard failure.

### 2026-07-11 — HITL `pending_approval` had no SLA clock
- **Symptom:** Guest room ask → red Inbox dot + Ops `pending_approval` task; reception ignores both → guest waits forever.
- **Root:** `sla-escalation-cron` only scanned `tasks.status='open'`. HITL gate never flipped → unassigned SLA never fired. Soft handoffs (`human_requested` only) had zero escalation path.
- **Fix pattern:** reuse `notify-manual-task` for auto-approve (don't duplicate Whapi card logic); split HARD (ops, 7 min, page management) vs SOFT (reception ping only, 20 min, never open field ops). Kill switch still `SLA_ESCALATION_ENABLED`.

### 2026-07-11 — CRA `npm start` OOM (Windows + Node 24)
- **Symptom:** `FATAL ERROR: invalid table size` / heap OOM ~900MB during webpack compile; `npm run build` often still OK.
- **False lead:** raising `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096` in PowerShell — on Windows the flag frequently never reaches the `react-scripts` child.
- **Fix:** put the flag on the Node that runs webpack: `node --max-old-space-size=8192 node_modules/react-scripts/bin/react-scripts.js start` in `package.json`. Optionally `.env.development` → `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` to cut peak heap in dev.
- **Do not** blame feature diffs first when build is clean and only `start` OOMs.

### 2026-07-08 — Session 144b (Inbox ghost outbound — Stage 2 + fetchAll race)
- **שורש 1:** `whatsapp-send` `stage_2_arrival` fast-path שלח ל-Meta + `notification_log` אבל **לא** `whatsapp_conversations` — cron reconcile / pipeline fallback בלתי-נראה ב-Inbox.
- **שורש 2:** `intent='arrival_confirmed'` נחסם ב-CHECK עד migration 157 — Meta הצליח, INSERT נכשל בשקט (`insertGuestOutboundIfNotMuted` רק `console.error`).
- **שורש 3 (פרונט):** `fetchAll` החליף את `allMsgsRef` במקום `mergeThreadRows` — שורה שהגיעה ב-Realtime באמצע fetch נמחקה עד רענון ידני.
- **תיקון:** conv log ב-whatsapp-send; retry `intent=null` על 23514; `fetchAll` additive; Realtime INSERT → תמיד `fetchSince`; migration 160 backfill מ-`notification_log`.

### 2026-07-07 — Session 131b (Anti-laziness hygiene — Design Mode, reuse-first, exact-match QA, no-autopilot)
- **Design Mode (§6 step 1b):** new/architecturally-unclear tasks now require 3 distinct proposed approaches, no code, before Mike picks one — catches the agent silently locking in an architecture Mike wouldn't have chosen.
- **Reuse-first (§6 step 3):** explicit instruction to search existing `_shared/`/utils before writing a new function — prevents near-duplicate helpers accumulating.
- **Exact-match self-verify (§6 step 5):** re-read Mike's original request line-by-line vs. what was built; flag any place a shortcut was taken because it was easier, don't ship the easier version silently.
- **§6.2 QA:** Mike names critical edge cases explicitly (not the agent guessing); self-review treated as first pass only on automation/payment/RLS work, per the "student grading their own exam" problem.
- **§7 No Auto-Piloting:** made explicit as a hard rule (was already true in practice via §2.1 Approval Loop) — no git/db/functions commands without Mike's explicit yes; local read-only commands (build/test) don't need approval; one phase at a time, never run ahead.

### 2026-07-07 — Session 131 (Prompt-engineering hygiene — external verify + reset-on-drift)
- **Most of the "role/task/constraints/examples/verify" formula was already in §6** — no need to duplicate. Two real gaps closed: (1) self-verification bias — a model checking its own diff tends to approve it; added §6 step 5b (spawn a `Plan` agent for high-stakes changes instead of self-check only). (2) drift handling — added §6.1: when the agent starts hallucinating/touching unrequested files, stop and ask Mike to open a fresh session rather than trying to self-correct mid-drift.
- **Not added (already covered elsewhere):** role framing → CLAUDE.md's fixed architect persona + per-skill agent types; Chain-of-Thought for logic bugs → already §6 step 2; constraints/examples → already §5.1 + §6 step 3.

### 2026-07-07 — Session 130 (Group remark occupants import)
- **שורש:** `sync_suite_arrivals` Tier-2 (order יחיד → עדכון אורח) דרס אורח-קבוצה שני באותה הזמנה — רק האחרון נשאר ב-DB (עיריית/הערות).
- **תיקון migration 147:** Tier-2 לא מתאים כש-`name`+`phone` שונים מאורח יחיד קיים על אותה הזמנה; INSERT נפרד לכל דייר מהערות.
- **`automation_muted` one-way:** ייבוא עם `automationMuted=true` מדליק mute (INSERT+UPDATE); לא מכבה unmute ידני של צוות.
- **Frontend:** `_getSyncProfileIndices` משתמש ב-`mergedCandidates[i].guestPhone` כ-fallback.

### 2026-07-07 — Session 129 (Import enrich mode)
- **`enrichOnly` ב-RPC** — `sync_suite_arrivals` (migration 146): פרופיל קיים מקבל רק שדות ריקים; INSERT חדש במלואו. `enrichOnly=false` = התנהגות 144 (ייבוא מלא).
- **UI** — מצב Doc 2 ברירת-מחדל «השלמת פרופיל»; עמודת «הבדל מול DB» ל-⚠ (שם/חדר/תאריך); `buildEnrichGuestPatch` לספא/ארוחה אחרי RPC.

### 2026-07-06 — Session 128 (Inbox guest emoji reactions)
- **Meta `type:"reaction"` ≠ טקסט מהאורח** — webhook יוצר שורת log סינתטית; ב-Inbox חייב `intent=guest_reaction` + chip UI (לא בועה inbound לבנה).
- **Snippet lookup דורש `wa_message_id` על outbound** — רוב השורות היו `null`; `_shared/metaWamid.ts` + שמירת wamid ב-`inbox_reply`/broadcast/pipeline. הודעות ישנות: fallback ל-outbound אחרון לאותו טלפון.
- **Unread** — reactions לא נספרות ב-`countUnreadInbound` (לא בקשת מענה).

### 2026-07-05 — Session 124 (Unified Ops UI + ACC day preview)
- **Resort Pulse = client projection** — `computeResortPulse` משתמש ב-`classifyInboxRosterSegment` (אותו מקור כמו Inbox) כדי שלא יהיו מונים סותרים בין Pulse לרשימת שיחות.
- **ACC day simulator** — `automation-queue` מקבל `POST { previewAt }` ומחזיר `systemStatus.previewAt`; אותו `resolveStageSchedule` כמו cron — לא סימולציה נפרדת בפרונט.
- **Journey timeline** — `buildGuestJourneyFromFlags` (msg_* ב-guests) + `mergeQueueIntoJourney` (skipReason מ-queue) ב-`GuestContextDrawer` — שני מקורות, UI אחד.
- **Cmd+K** — `openDreamBotChat` חייב לאפשר פתיחת Inbox בלי `phone` (ניווט בלבד).

### 2026-07-05 — Session 123 (checkout_fb sent to future guest — lifecycle gate)
- **שורש:** `checkout_fb` (תבנית «השערים נסגרו…») נשען רק על `departure_date`+`day_offset` — בלי לוודא ש-`arrival_date` עבר, שהאורח צ'ק-אין, או שתאריכי שהות תקינים. פרופיל עם `departure_date` שגוי (או לפני `arrival_date`) יכול לקבל שלב 5 לפני ההגעה.
- **תיקון:** `_shared/pipelineLifecycle.ts` — `assertPipelineLifecycleForTrigger`: post-stay דורש `arrival_date ≤ היום`, `departure_date < היום`, סטטוס לא `pending`/`expected`; in-stay/morning חסומים לעתידיים; `invalid_stay_dates` כשעזיבה לפני הגעה. `checkEligibility`+`whatsapp-send` BRANCH D+cron `loadGuestByIdForPipeline` (מאפשר `checked_out` רק ל-post-stay).
- **QA:** בדוק אורח עתידי עם תאריך עזיבה שגוי ב-ACC Queue — שלב 5 צריך `skipReason=guest_not_arrived` / `invalid_stay_dates`, לא «מוכן לשליחה».

### 2026-07-05 — Session 122 (Guest delete → full system sync)
- **מחיקת אורח = hard DELETE דרך RPC בלבד** — `delete_guest_profile` (141) מבטל `scheduled_tasks` pending ואז `DELETE guests`; `GuestDashboard`/`GuestsPage` לא קוראים יותר `.delete()` ישיר.
- **Inbox stale «מחר»** — `groupByPhone`+`inboxMemoryCache` שמרו `arrivalDate` אחרי מחיקה; תיקון: `syncInboxContactWithGuestMap`+`classifyInboxContactSegment` (בלי `guestId` → `no_date`, לא «מחר»); realtime DELETE מנקה cache.
- **שליחה ללא אורח** — `guestOutboundGuard.ts`: חסום `cancelled`/`checked_out`/מחוק; `inbox_reply` דורש שורת guests פעילה; webhook Stage2+LLM auto-reply מדולגים; cron re-check לפני dispatch.
- **REPLICA IDENTITY FULL** על `guests` (142) — `payload.old.phone` ב-DELETE ל-Inbox realtime.

### 2026-07-04 — Session 109 (guest_request → Whapi ops card completeness)
- **Whapi card without suite = `guests.room` null** at intercept time — fix: `_shared/guestRoomResolve.ts` falls back to `suite_rooms` by phone + `resolveSuiteFromEzgoFields`; best-effort backfill `guests.room`. Card uses `Room אמטיסט 8 - …`, never bare `Room —`.
- **guest_request tasks had no SLA** — now `sla_category` + `sla_deadline` (15m amenities / 30m maintenance), same buckets as `whapi-webhook` staff reports; `sla-escalation-cron` picks them up.
- **Dept split:** amenities/HK → `משק`; maintenance → `תפעול` via `resolveGuestOpsDepartment()`.
- **Tier-0 + LLM dispatch** expanded: `isGuestEligibleForInHouseOpsDispatch` = checked_in OR on-property arrival day (`expected`/`room_ready`/`pending`), not only post-15:00 `checked_in`. Future-guest `guest_alerts` block skips when eligible.

### 2026-07-04 — Session 108 (Shabbat arrival hours — entry always 12:00)
- **כניסה למתחם = 12:00 תמיד** (חול + שבת). **קבלת חדרים/סוויטות** = 15:00 חול / 18:00 שבת בלבד.
- `applySaturdayCheckInTimeOverride` היה ממיר 12:00→15:00 בשבת (באג שגרם להודעת בוקר עם כניסה 15:00) — עכשיו רק 15:00→18:00 לצ׳ק-אין.
- migration 128 מתקן `bot_config.night_before_entry_time_shabbat` מ-15:00 ל-12:00 (טעות migration 126).

### 2026-07-04 — Session 102b (Stage 3 morning Shabbat routing)
- **Same rule as Stage 2.5:** autonomous `morning_suite`/`morning_welcome` → `suite_welcome_morning` / `suite_welcome_morning_shabbat` Meta templates only. No `stage_3_morning` session hijack on open 24h window. Day-pass `morning_welcome` aligned. Shabbat template failure → session script + `applySaturdayCheckInTimeOverride`, **not** weekday Meta (15:00 leak).

### 2026-07-04 — Session 102 (Stage 2.5 Shabbat routing)
- **Autonomous night_before must never hijack to session text on open 24h window.** Cron/default → `night_before_suites` / `night_before_suites_shabbat` Meta templates (times baked in). Session `bot_scripts` only on manual `force` / `force_channel=session_message`. Open window + weekday script = 12:00/15:00 leak on Saturday arrivals.

### 2026-07-04 — Session 101 (EZGO remark identity gate)
- **sRemark is NOT always the guest name.** Only when the same `sClientFullName` appears on 2+ rows in one import file (municipal/group bookings) does `aggregateGuestProfiles` set `coordNameDuplicated` and pull name+phone from remarks. Solo rows use column name + `sTel1` only — ops phrases in remarks (birthday, meal notes) must never become `guestName`.

### 2026-06-30 — Session 74b (dual-surface UI)
- **Desktop Wow + Mobile comfort:** same phase, two acceptance gates — DevTools 390/768/1280 every phase + Mobile Checklist before deploy.
- **Phase 4 added:** App.js mobile shell (`mobile-bar`, hamburger) + `GuestsPage.js` check-in on phone.
- **Phase 5:** real phone sign-off on Vercel per phase batch.

### 2026-06-30 — Session 74 (workflow + UI strategy)
- **Desktop-first for dev speed:** `npm start` + DevTools; real phone = phase sign-off on Vercel.
- **Token split:** Mike → agent in English; agent → Mike in Hebrew; UI stays Hebrew in code.
- **UI prompt corrections:** Dashboard KPIs ≠ OperationsBoard; "שגר עכשיו" ≠ Inbox; OpsBoard uses TaskCards not tables; AICopilot overlap already fixed s52.
- **Phase 0 required:** WhatsAppInbox has ~222 hardcoded hex — add App.js tokens before component polish.
- **Staff "Wow" ≠ decoration:** RESORT_UI_MANIFEST — certainty, speed, scannable badges; soft shadows OK, heavy motion not.
- **Co-Pilot deploy:** Mike approves with `yes`/`כן`/`תעלה` — agent runs full deploy, not just a command table.

### 2026-06-30 — Prior sessions (reference only)
- AI rules edit/delete in BotSettings (migration 112).
- Ops Board tasks Realtime (migration 111).
- In-room context override + burst dedup in webhook.
- Record-only ETA, receptionist RBAC, needs_callback decoupled from bot.
- See `CLAUDE.md` §10 for full history.

## 11. Desktop Session Kickoff — ONE MESSAGE (Mike copy-paste this entire block)

@CLAUDE.md @docs/active_sprint.md @docs/xos_agent_playbook.md @RESORT_UI_MANIFEST.md
@src/App.js @.cursorrules

XOS Co-Pilot — EXECUTE UI upgrade (Mike approval workflow)
You are the same architect as cloud sessions. Read all @ files first.

Mike's workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE — this is how we worked before and Mike loved it)
Make ONE small visual change (or complete one clear step).

Tell Mike in Hebrew (short):

Open http://localhost:3000

Which screen/tab to click (Hebrew nav name)

Exactly what should look different

Mobile: F12 → 390px if relevant

STOP and WAIT. Do NOT make the next change until Mike replies.

Mike approves with: כן / yes / המשך

Only when a phase batch is done AND Mike is happy → ask:
"לבצע commit + push לפרודקשן?"

Push ONLY when Mike says: כן / yes / תעלה / yes deploy

Never push silently. Never skip the "where to look" step.

Mike does NOT read code. Mike looks at the browser (npm start is running).

What we planned (execute in order)
GOAL: Staff UI — desktop "Wow" + mobile comfort. Visual only.

Phase 0: App.js — design tokens + utility classes + mobile hit-target vars
Phase 1: WhatsAppInbox.js — roster, badges, CTAs (+ mobile swipe/reply bar)
Phase 2a: Dashboard KPI cards (App.js ~1166-1204) — NOT OperationsBoard
Phase 2b: OperationsBoard.js — TaskCards + filter chips (not a table)
Phase 3: HousekeepingTabletView.js 72px buttons + verify AICopilot vs mobile-bar
Phase 4: App.js mobile-bar/hamburger + GuestsPage.js on phone
Phase 5: Mike tests on phone at dream-ai-system.vercel.app after deploy

Rules: CSS variables only, Disable-Don't-Hide, no Hebrew label changes, no logic, no .env
After each phase: Mobile Checklist (playbook §5.5) + npm run build before commit

Your FIRST reply (Hebrew, max 12 lines)
Confirm git commit hash after pull

Confirm npm start assumption

Phase 0 diagnostic — list App.js lines you will touch

Ask: "להתחיל שינוי ראשון?" — wait for כן

Do NOT write code in the first reply unless Mike already said כן below.

Mike says now:
כן — התחל Phase 0. אחרי כל שינוי תראה לי בדפדפן ותחכה לאישור לפני commit/push.
